SqlConnectivityTester
=====================

This handy little windows application will help you test a connection to any MSSql instance.

I often connected to a windows server which had only the bare minimum software installed. 
This gets frustrating when you are installing services on the machine and you're not sure if those services will be
able to connect to any specific sql instance.
I wrote this small application to quickly and easily enter in a connection string and test if that connection string was valid.

Feel free to make any changes you want, or use it in any environment that you need it.
